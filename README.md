[Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com) is a stack of security libraries and all the necessary infrastructure to enable seamless, end-to-end encryption for any application, platform or device.

Our libraries allow developers to get up and running with Virgil API quickly and add full end-to-end security to their existing digital solutions to become HIPAA and GDPR compliant and more.

Virgil Security, Inc. guides software developers into the forthcoming security world in which everything will be encrypted (and passwords will be eliminated). In this world, the days of developers having to raise millions of dollars to build secure chat, secure email, secure file-sharing, or a secure anything have come to an end. Now developers can instead focus on building features that give them a competitive market advantage while end-users can enjoy the privacy and security they increasingly demand.

# Products

### Tools
* [Virgil CLI](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-cli) - a tool to manage your Virgil account and applications, and perform cryptographic operations.
* [IoT Dev Tools](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit#iot-dev-tools). Virgil Security also provides a set of tools for secure device lifecycle:
  - **Virgil Trust Provisioner**. The Virgil Trust Provisioner is a CLI used to manage your distributed trust between all parties, including IoT devices, in your IoT solutions. The CLI is aimed at key pairs and TrustList generation and management, which together make each IoT device identifiable, verifiable and trusted by each party of IoT solution. To start working with the tool, read more [here](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit/tree/master/tools/virgil-trust-provisioner).
  - **Virgil Device Initializer**. In order to make each IoT device identifiable, verifiable and trusted by each party of IoT solution, you have to provide it with specific provision files, generate private keys and create the digital cards for further device registration on the Virgil Cloud. Virgil Device Initializer allows you to make IoT device provisioning and prepare your IoT device (create digital cards) for its further registration on the Virgil Cloud. To start working with the tool, read more [here](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit/tree/master/tools/virgil-device-initializer).
  - **Virgil Device Registrar**. Virgil IoT Device Registrar is used to register IoT devices and their digital cards with the Virgil Security Cloud. To start working with the tool, read more [here](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit/tree/master/tools/virgil-device-registrar).
  - **Virgil Firmware Signer**. Virgil Firmware Signer is a CLI that allows you to sign firmware in order to provide integrity before distributing it. To start working with the tool, read more [here](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit/tree/master/tools/virgil-firmware-signer).
  - **Virgil SnapD**. Virgil SnapD is a local web utility which allows you to obtain information and statistics about your IoT devices. In order to get such device information, SnapD interacts with Virgil SNAP protocol, which operates directly with your IoT devices. As far as Virgil SnapD is a local service, the obtained information can be displayed in browser under http://localhost:8080/ (by default). If you're working with the Virgil IoT Simulator, you can run SnapD under http://localhost:8081/. To start working with the tool, read more [here](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-iotkit/tree/master/tools/virgil-snapd).
